    <h3>Choose the Best Location to Build Your Fortress:</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout any match, it's a common strategy to collect a massive amount of resources (woods, stone, and metal), so that if you survive until the End Game, you're able to construct a tall and sturdy fortress from which you'll launch your final attacks.
        To adopt this strategy, you'll want to gather at least 1,500 wood, stone, and/or metal by the time the End Game portion of a match begins. Next, select the type of fortress you want to build. A common strategy is to keep the design simple, but functional.
        Wait until you know the location of the final circle before building your fortress, and then choose the most strategic location that'll allow you to see your opponents. However, avoid being in the dead-center of the final circle, or you'll become the center of attention, and all remaining players will focus on killing you off first.
    </p>
         <h3>Make Sure Your Fortress is Sturdy, Tall, and Offers a Great View:</h3>
        <p>          
            When constructing your final fortress, make sure the bottom portion is extra sturdy. Consider building the first level or two using metal. Otherwise, an enemy can focus on destroying the bottom level, forcing the entire structure to come crashing down. This will result in you potentially falling to your death.
            A fortress should also be as tall as possible, giving you a bird's eye view of your enemies and the surrounding area within the final circle.
        </p>
         <h3>Don't Engage Everyone:</h3>
        <p>
            As the End Game portion of a match begins, allow the other players to fight amongst themselves first. Some remaining players will get killed off, and those that remain will then have less resources and ammo. This will give you a tactical advantage once you launch your own attacks. You'll also have time to study your enemies and learn what strategies they use, based on the weapons they appear to have in their respective arsenals.
        </p>
                    <h3>Keep Tabs On All Remaining Players:</h3>
        <p>
            You always know how many players remain in the match. One important responsibility during the End Game, is to keep tabs on the location of all remaining players. You don't want anyone sneaking up on you and being able to launch a successful surprise attack.
            If you have your back to the edge of the storm, for example, don't assume you're safe. An adversary may enter into the storm to reposition themselves behind you when you're not looking, and then launch a surprise attack by rushing your fort.
        </p>
                    <h3>Be Prepared to Adapt Your Strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            You may enter into an End Game thinking you'll stay within the confines of your fortress and shoot at enemies from a distance. However, you also need to be prepared if someone opts to rush your fort and move in for a close-range attack.
            Plus, if an enemy attack successfully destroys your fortress and you survive, you'll want to be able to defend yourself and launch short-range attacks. You might decide to quickly build a ramp in order to reach a higher level, or rush your opponent's fortress with a shotgun and grenades in hand.
       </p>
            <h3>Try to Focus on One Enemy at a Time:</h3>
        <p>
            Especially during the End Game, several skilled gamers may be controlling soldiers on multiple sides of your current location. Instead of engaging all of them at once, try focusing on one enemy at a time, but keep tabs on the locations of everyone else.
        </p>
         <h3>Learn from the Pros & Practice:</h3>
        <p>
               The best way to discover strategies that work is to study top-ranked players by watching videos and live streams they participate in. You'll find these, for free, on YouTube and Twitch.tv. Within the Search field of either service, type "Fortnite: Battle Royale" or "Fortnite: Battle Royale Strategies."
               Once you've discovered the very best strategies to use, the key to becoming an expert player is lots of practice. You need to be able to build, explore, fight, and survive, and handle all required tasks very quickly and with precision.
